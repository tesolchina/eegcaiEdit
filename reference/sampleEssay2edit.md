## Student Essay (Original Version)

**Climate Change and Individual Actions**

Climate change is a big problem that affects everyone. Some people think that individual actions are not important compared to what governments and companies do. I think that individual actions are important but they are not enough to solve climate change by themselves.

Individual actions can influence government policies through voting and political pressure. When people care about the environment, they vote for politicians who will make environmental laws. Also, when people protest and demand action, governments listen to their citizens. This shows that individual actions can lead to government changes.

Individual actions can also affect what companies do through consumer choices. When people buy electric cars, companies will make more of them. Also, when people choose green products, companies will produce more environmentally friendly items. This shows that individual choices can influence corporate behavior.

However, individual actions alone cannot solve climate change because the problem is too big. Most pollution comes from factories and power plants that individuals cannot control. Governments need to make laws to reduce emissions from these sources. Also, building renewable energy like solar panels costs a lot of money that only governments can provide.

In conclusion, individual actions are important but not enough by themselves. We need both individual actions and government actions to solve climate change. Everyone should do their part, but we also need strong policies to make real change happen.

## Specific Issues to Address

### 1. **Thesis Statement Issues**
- **Current**: "I think that individual actions are important but they are not enough to solve climate change by themselves"
- **Issue**: Vague and doesn't directly address the "extent" question - doesn't clearly state to what extent individual actions are significant
- **Missing Elements**: Doesn't incorporate the two specific points about citizens influencing government and consumers affecting corporations
- **Improvement needed**: Clear thesis that addresses the "extent" question and incorporates both points about individual influence on government and corporations

### 2. **Body Paragraph Structure Issues**
- **Current**: Two body paragraphs each focus on one point (citizens influencing government, consumers affecting corporations)
- **Issue**: Topic sentences are too general and don't clearly connect to thesis points
- **Problem**: "Individual actions can influence government policies" doesn't specify HOW or to what extent
- **Improvement needed**: More specific topic sentences that directly support the thesis with clear arguments about the extent of influence

### 3. **Weak Evidence and Examples**
- **Current**: Very general examples like "when people buy electric cars, companies will make more of them"
- **Issue**: No specific data, statistics, or concrete evidence to support claims
- **Improvement needed**: Specific examples with data, research findings, or concrete evidence for both government and corporate influence

### 4. **Surface-Level Analysis**
- **Current**: Basic explanations without depth or critical thinking
- **Issue**: "This shows that individual choices can influence corporate behavior" - no analysis of HOW or WHY
- **Improvement needed**: Deeper analysis of mechanisms and relationships for both government and corporate influence

### 5. **Missing Counter-arguments**
- **Current**: No consideration of opposing viewpoints
- **Issue**: Doesn't address why some people believe individual actions are insignificant
- **Improvement needed**: Acknowledge and respond to opposing arguments about the limitations of individual influence

### 6. **Weak Conclusion**
- **Current**: Simply restates the thesis without synthesis
- **Issue**: No forward-looking perspective or deeper insights
- **Improvement needed**: Synthesis of arguments and implications for the future

### 7. **Surface-Level Issues**
- **Grammar**: Some awkward phrasing and sentence structure
- **Vocabulary**: Limited academic vocabulary and repetitive word choice
- **Organization**: Basic structure but lacks sophisticated logical flow
- **Register**: Too informal for academic writing

## Thesis Statement Development Guidance

### **Current Thesis Problems:**
- Too vague about the "extent" of individual action significance
- Doesn't incorporate the two specific points about government and corporate influence
- Lacks clear position on the essay question

### **Improved Thesis Should Include:**
1. **Clear position** on the extent of individual action significance
2. **Two specific points** about how individuals influence:
   - Government policies (as citizens)
   - Corporate decisions (as consumers)
3. **Extent qualification** - to what degree these influences are significant

### **Example Thesis Framework:**
"While individual actions may seem insignificant compared to government and corporate efforts, they are actually [extent] significant because individuals can influence government policies as citizens and affect corporate decisions as consumers, though their impact is limited by [qualification]."

## Learning Objectives for AI Training

This sample essay provides opportunities for students to practice all four learning goals:

### **Goal 1: Provide Contextual Information**
- Students must explain the essay question and identify the specific writing issues
- They need to articulate which problems they want to focus on (thesis development, evidence, analysis, etc.)
- They should provide context about their academic level and revision goals
- They need to explain their understanding of the two main points (citizens influencing government, consumers affecting corporations)

### **Goal 2: Negotiate with AI on Agenda and Goals**
- Students must prioritize which issues to address first (thesis development vs. evidence vs. grammar)
- They need to negotiate with AI about the most effective revision approach
- They should consider whether to focus on thesis statement development or body paragraph improvement first
- They need to discuss how to incorporate both points into a clear thesis

### **Goal 3: Critically Review AI Responses**
- Students should question AI suggestions about thesis improvement and ask for explanations
- They need to evaluate AI recommendations for how to incorporate both points into the thesis
- They should assess whether AI advice addresses the specific problems in their essay
- They should critically evaluate suggestions for improving the connection between thesis and body paragraphs

### **Goal 4: Do Your Own Writing and Editing**
- Students must implement all revisions themselves, not just accept AI suggestions
- They should make final decisions about which improvements to make
- They need to maintain ownership of their writing process and final product
- They must write their own improved thesis statement incorporating both points
