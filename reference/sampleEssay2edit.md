## Student Essay (Original Version)

**Climate Change and Individual Actions**

Climate change is a big problem that affects everyone. Some people think that individual actions are not important compared to what governments and companies do. I think that individual actions are important but they are not enough to solve climate change by themselves.

Individual actions can make a difference because when many people do the same thing, it adds up. For example, if people recycle more, it helps the environment. Also, when people buy electric cars, companies will make more of them. This shows that individual choices can influence what companies do.

However, individual actions alone cannot solve climate change because the problem is too big. Most pollution comes from factories and power plants that individuals cannot control. Governments need to make laws to reduce emissions from these sources. Also, building renewable energy like solar panels costs a lot of money that only governments can provide.

Individual actions and government actions work together to fight climate change. When people care about the environment, they vote for politicians who will make environmental laws. Also, when people change their behavior, it shows companies that there is demand for green products. This creates a cycle where individual actions lead to bigger changes.

In conclusion, individual actions are important but not enough by themselves. We need both individual actions and government actions to solve climate change. Everyone should do their part, but we also need strong policies to make real change happen.

## Specific Issues to Address

### 1. **Thesis Statement Issues**
- **Current**: "I think that individual actions are important but they are not enough to solve climate change by themselves"
- **Issue**: Vague and doesn't directly address the "extent" question - doesn't clearly state to what extent individual actions are significant
- **Improvement needed**: Clear position on the extent of agreement/disagreement with specific reasoning

### 2. **Topic Sentence Problems**
- **Current**: Topic sentences are too general and don't clearly connect to thesis points
- **Issue**: "Individual actions can make a difference" doesn't specify HOW or to what extent
- **Improvement needed**: More specific topic sentences that directly support the thesis with clear arguments

### 3. **Weak Evidence and Examples**
- **Current**: Very general examples like "if people recycle more, it helps the environment"
- **Issue**: No specific data, statistics, or concrete evidence to support claims
- **Improvement needed**: Specific examples with data, research findings, or concrete evidence

### 4. **Surface-Level Analysis**
- **Current**: Basic explanations without depth or critical thinking
- **Issue**: "This shows that individual choices can influence what companies do" - no analysis of HOW or WHY
- **Improvement needed**: Deeper analysis of mechanisms and relationships

### 5. **Missing Counter-arguments**
- **Current**: No consideration of opposing viewpoints
- **Issue**: Doesn't address why some people believe individual actions are insignificant
- **Improvement needed**: Acknowledge and respond to opposing arguments

### 6. **Weak Conclusion**
- **Current**: Simply restates the thesis without synthesis
- **Issue**: No forward-looking perspective or deeper insights
- **Improvement needed**: Synthesis of arguments and implications for the future

### 7. **Surface-Level Issues**
- **Grammar**: Some awkward phrasing and sentence structure
- **Vocabulary**: Limited academic vocabulary and repetitive word choice
- **Organization**: Basic structure but lacks sophisticated logical flow
- **Register**: Too informal for academic writing

## Learning Objectives for AI Training

This sample essay provides opportunities for students to practice all four learning goals:

### **Goal 1: Provide Contextual Information**
- Students must explain the essay question and identify the specific writing issues
- They need to articulate which problems they want to focus on (thesis, evidence, analysis, etc.)
- They should provide context about their academic level and revision goals

### **Goal 2: Negotiate with AI on Agenda and Goals**
- Students must prioritize which issues to address first (thesis vs. evidence vs. grammar)
- They need to negotiate with AI about the most effective revision approach
- They should consider whether to focus on content issues or surface-level problems first

### **Goal 3: Critically Review AI Responses**
- Students should question AI suggestions about thesis improvement and ask for explanations
- They need to evaluate AI recommendations for evidence and examples critically
- They should assess whether AI advice addresses the specific problems in their essay

### **Goal 4: Do Your Own Writing and Editing**
- Students must implement all revisions themselves, not just accept AI suggestions
- They should make final decisions about which improvements to make
- They need to maintain ownership of their writing process and final product
