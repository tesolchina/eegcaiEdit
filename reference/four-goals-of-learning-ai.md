# Four Goals of Learning AI - Comprehensive Framework

## Overview
This document outlines the four essential goals for students learning to collaborate effectively with AI systems in academic writing contexts. These goals form the foundation of the AI Training and Assessment Component for remedial English courses, specifically designed for LANG 0036: Enhancing English through Global Citizenship.

## The Four Learning Goals

### Goal 1: Provide Contextual Information
**Objective**: Students learn to provide comprehensive context to AI systems for better assistance.

#### Initial Interaction Process
**Chatbot Opening**: "Thanks for sharing the essay! Could you provide more info about the task you're working on and tell me what help you need?"

**Student Response Requirements**:
- **Personal Context**: Who they are (course, year level)
- **Academic Context**: What course they're taking
- **Task Context**: The specific task/assignment details
- **Session Goals**: Their goals for this particular session

#### Follow-up Context Provision
**Chatbot Follow-up**: "How would you like to edit the essay?"

**Student Response Requirements**:
- **Assessment Awareness**: Mention there are two rubrics for assessment
- **Dual Evaluation Understanding**: They'll be evaluated on essay revision AND AI communication
- **Priority Setting**: Their specific revision priorities

#### Key Learning Outcomes
- **Contextual Communication**: Students practice providing comprehensive context to AI for better assistance
- **Information Organization**: Learn to structure and prioritize contextual information
- **Assessment Awareness**: Understand dual evaluation criteria (essay quality + AI communication skills)
- **Strategic Planning**: Develop skills in setting clear session objectives

#### Practical Applications
- **Course Information Sharing**: Students learn to provide relevant academic context
- **Assignment Details**: Practice explaining specific task requirements
- **Goal Articulation**: Develop skills in clearly stating revision objectives
- **Assessment Preparation**: Understand evaluation criteria before beginning work

### Goal 2: Negotiate with AI on Agenda and Goals
**Objective**: Students develop strategic planning and priority-setting skills in AI collaboration.

#### Process Overview
1. **Diagnosis Phase**: Students receive diagnosis of their essay against the rubrics
2. **Decision Making**: They must decide which issues to focus on
3. **Self-Reflection**: They should reflect on their strengths and weaknesses as writers
4. **Time Management**: They need to consider time constraints
5. **Strategic Planning**: AI guides students to focus on macro-level issues first

#### AI Guidance Framework
**Macro-Level Priority**: Content and organization issues first
**Micro-Level Priority**: Grammar and vocabulary issues second
**Strategic Focus**: AI guides students to prioritize structural improvements over surface-level corrections

#### Key Learning Outcomes
- **Strategic Planning**: Students learn strategic planning and priority-setting in revision
- **Critical Decision Making**: Develop skills in evaluating and selecting revision focus areas
- **Self-Assessment**: Practice reflecting on personal writing strengths and weaknesses
- **Time Management**: Learn to work within constraints while maximizing impact
- **Hierarchical Thinking**: Understand the importance of addressing major issues before minor ones

#### Practical Applications
- **Issue Prioritization**: Students learn to identify and rank writing problems
- **Resource Allocation**: Practice allocating time and effort strategically
- **Goal Negotiation**: Develop skills in discussing and refining revision objectives with AI
- **Progress Planning**: Learn to create realistic revision timelines

### Goal 3: Critically Review AI Responses
**Objective**: Students develop critical thinking skills to evaluate AI assistance rather than blindly accepting suggestions.

#### Expected Student Behavior
**Questioning AI Suggestions**:
- Ask AI to explain suggestions with reference to rubrics and linguistic concepts
- Question and evaluate AI recommendations
- Seek clarification on unclear or questionable advice
- Request specific examples and evidence for suggestions

**Critical Evaluation Process**:
- Compare AI suggestions against assessment rubrics
- Evaluate the relevance and appropriateness of recommendations
- Consider alternative approaches and solutions
- Make informed decisions about which suggestions to implement

**Future Development Feature**:
- Students may seek a second opinion from a different AI system
- This feature will be developed for enhanced critical evaluation

#### Key Learning Outcomes
- **Critical Thinking**: Students develop critical thinking skills to evaluate AI assistance
- **Analytical Skills**: Learn to analyze and assess AI recommendations
- **Evidence-Based Decision Making**: Practice making decisions based on evidence and criteria
- **Independent Judgment**: Develop confidence in their own analytical abilities
- **Rubric Application**: Learn to apply assessment criteria to evaluate suggestions

#### Practical Applications
- **Question Formulation**: Students learn to ask probing questions about AI suggestions
- **Evidence Evaluation**: Practice assessing the quality and relevance of AI recommendations
- **Alternative Consideration**: Develop skills in considering multiple approaches
- **Decision Documentation**: Learn to justify their choices and decisions

---

### Goal 4: Do Your Own Writing and Editing
**Objective**: Students maintain ownership of their work while using AI as a thinking partner.

#### Fundamental Rule
**AI Role Limitation**: AI should NOT do the editing for students - they must do the actual writing and editing themselves.

#### Role Definitions
**AI Role**:
- Provide suggestions and guidance only
- Act as a thinking partner and advisor
- Offer feedback and recommendations
- Support the student's decision-making process

**Student Role**:
- Make final decisions about all changes
- Implement all revisions personally
- Maintain complete ownership of their work
- Take responsibility for all writing and editing decisions

#### Key Learning Outcomes
- **Ownership Maintenance**: Students maintain ownership of their work while using AI as a thinking partner
- **Independent Writing**: Develop confidence in their own writing and editing abilities
- **Decision Making**: Practice making final decisions about their work
- **Responsibility**: Learn to take ownership of their writing process
- **Collaboration Skills**: Develop skills in using AI as a supportive tool rather than a replacement

#### Practical Applications
- **Writing Practice**: Students engage in actual writing and revision work
- **Decision Ownership**: Practice making independent decisions about their writing
- **Skill Development**: Continue developing their own writing and editing skills
- **Confidence Building**: Build confidence in their ability to write and revise effectively

## Integration with Assessment Framework

### Dual Assessment Approach
Students are evaluated on two dimensions:

1. **Essay Quality Assessment**
   - Uses standard essay rubrics for writing quality
   - Evaluates improvement from original to revised essay
   - Measures structural and content improvements
   - Assesses writing quality enhancement across all dimensions

2. **AI Communication Skills Assessment**
   - Uses detailed AI collaboration rubrics
   - Evaluates context provision quality (Goal 1)
   - Assesses critical thinking demonstration (Goal 3)
   - Measures strategic planning evidence (Goal 2)
   - Evaluates decision-making autonomy (Goal 4)

### Rubric Integration
Each goal corresponds to specific assessment criteria:

- **Goal 1 (Context Provision)**: Evaluated on comprehensiveness and relevance of contextual information provided
- **Goal 2 (Goal Negotiation)**: Assessed on strategic planning and priority-setting abilities
- **Goal 3 (Critical Review)**: Measured by quality of critical evaluation and questioning
- **Goal 4 (Independent Work)**: Evaluated on evidence of student ownership and decision-making
