**User**

we need a new note (md) to describe the user journey) 

we need to redesign this html page 

to clarify this is the training mode for an AI training and assessment component of a remedial English course 

for the training mode, the AI platform would first present a sample essay for the students' reference (it can be toggled)
then the AI chatbot (system) would guide the students to 
1 locate the sentence where the thesis statement should be written 
2 assess the thesis statement (whether address the essay question; include 2 points)
3 revise the thesis statement
4 locate the topic sentences 
5 assess whether the topic sentences echo and support the points in the thesis statement
6 revise the topic sentences 
5 assess the development of one body paragraph 
6 revise the body paragraph by addressing just one issue

also describe the UI based on /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/EEGC_aiedit/training.html

at this stage no need to write new html codes

**Cursor**

I'll help you create a comprehensive note describing the user journey for the AI training and assessment component, and analyze the current HTML page to understand the UI design. Let me start by examining the existing files and then create the documentation.


Now let me read the intro file to get a complete picture:


Let me read the intro file in smaller chunks:

3. **Reference Framework**: The sample demonstrates proper thesis statement, topic sentences, and paragraph development
4. **Interactive Elements**: Students can click on different parts of the essay to see explanations

**Learning Outcome**: Students understand what a well-structured essay looks like before attempting their own revisions.

### Phase 2: AI-Guided Thesis Statement Work

#### Step 1: Locate Thesis Statement
**AI Guidance**: "First, let's find the thesis statement in your essay"

**Student Actions**:
- Review their introduction paragraph
- Click on the sentence they believe is the thesis statement
- Receive immediate feedback on their selection

**AI Assessment**:
- Confirms if the selected sentence is indeed the thesis
- Explains why the sentence is or isn't the thesis
- Provides hints if the student selects incorrectly

**Learning Outcome**: Students learn to identify thesis statements in their own writing.

#### Step 2: Assess Thesis Statement Quality
**AI Guidance**: "Now let's check if your thesis statement effectively answers the essay question"

**Assessment Criteria**:
- Does the thesis directly address the essay question?
- Does it take a clear position?
- Is it specific enough to guide the essay?

**Student Actions**:
- Click "Ask AI" to get assessment
- Read AI feedback on their thesis quality
- Understand what makes a strong thesis statement

**AI Feedback Examples**:
- "Your thesis doesn't directly answer the question. Try restating it to clearly show your position."
- "Good! Your thesis takes a clear stance. Now let's check if it has specific points to develop."

#### Step 3: Check for Specific Points
**AI Guidance**: "A strong thesis should contain 2-3 specific points that you'll develop in your body paragraphs"

**Assessment Focus**:
- Does the thesis contain 2-3 distinct main points?
- Are the points specific enough to guide paragraph development?
- Do the points logically connect to the essay question?

**Student Learning**:
- Understand the difference between vague and specific thesis statements
- Learn to structure thesis statements with clear supporting points

#### Step 4: Revise Thesis Statement
**AI Guidance**: "Based on the feedback, revise your thesis statement to make it stronger"

**Student Actions**:

#### Step 5: Locate Topic Sentences
**AI Guidance**: "Now let's find and examine your topic sentences"

**Student Actions**:
- Identify the first sentence of each body paragraph
- Click on sentences they believe are topic sentences
- Receive feedback on their selections

**Learning Outcome**: Students learn to identify topic sentences and understand their role in essay structure.

#### Step 6: Assess Topic Sentence Quality
**AI Guidance**: "Do your topic sentences clearly connect to and develop the points from your thesis?"

**Assessment Criteria**:
- Do topic sentences echo specific points from the thesis?
- Do they provide clear direction for paragraph development?
- Are they specific enough to guide the paragraph content?

**AI Feedback Process**:
- Analyzes each topic sentence against thesis points
- Identifies gaps or misalignments
- Suggests specific improvements

#### Step 7: Revise Topic Sentences
**AI Guidance**: "Revise your topic sentences to better connect to your thesis points"

**Student Actions**:
- Revise each topic sentence based on AI feedback
- Test revisions with AI assessment
- Ensure clear connection to thesis statement

### Phase 4: Body Paragraph Development

#### Step 8: Assess Body Paragraph Development
**AI Guidance**: "Let's examine how well one of your body paragraphs develops its topic sentence"

**Focus Areas**:
- Does the paragraph provide sufficient evidence or examples?
- Is the development logical and coherent?
- Does it stay focused on the topic sentence?

**AI Assessment**:
- Identifies specific issues in paragraph development
- Suggests areas for improvement
- Provides examples of effective development

#### Step 9: Revise Body Paragraph
**AI Guidance**: "Choose one issue to address and revise your paragraph accordingly"

**Student Actions**:
- Select one specific issue to focus on (e.g., add more evidence, improve transitions, clarify examples)
- Revise the paragraph to address that issue
- Test the revision with AI feedback

**Learning Outcome**: Students learn to identify and address specific writing issues rather than trying to fix everything at once.

**Cursor**

I understand you want to consolidate and merge the current folder structure. Let me help you move everything from the cloned repository back to the parent directory and clean up the structure.


Now let me move all the files from the current directory (eegcaiEdit) to the parent directory and clean up:


Now let me remove the empty eegcaiEdit directory and check the git status:


Perfect! Let me verify the final structure:

let's remove the files not relevant to EEGC AI edit

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you clean up the `new-bytewise-frontend` directory by removing files that are not relevant to the EEGC AI edit project. Let me first examine the current structure and then remove the irrelevant files.


Now let me identify the files that are relevant to EEGC AI edit and remove the irrelevant ones:


Now let me remove the irrelevant bot configuration files:


Now let me check the components and views to see what's relevant to EEGC AI edit:


Let me check what's in the writing_bot component since that seems most relevant:


Based on the EEGC AI edit project focus, let me remove the avatar-related components and views since they're not relevant to essay writing and AI training:


Let me also check if there are any other irrelevant files and clean up the text_chatbot component if it's not needed for EEGC:


Since the EEGC project focuses on writing and essay training, let me keep the text_chatbot components as they might be useful for the chat interface, but let me check if we need the ChatPage view:


Let me check the router to see what routes are defined and remove unnecessary ones:


Now let me clean up the router and remove the avatar route and ChatPage since they're not needed for EEGC:


```javascript
// src/router/index.js
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
import Home from '../views/HomePage.vue'
import WritingBot from '../views/WritingBot.vue'
import NotFound from '../views/NotFound.vue'
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'Home',
    component: Home
  },
  {
    path: '/EEGC',
    name: 'EEGC',
    component: WritingBot
  },
  {
    path: '/:pathMatch(.*)*',
    name: 'NotFound',
    component: NotFound
  }
]

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes
})

export default router

```

Now let me remove the ChatPage view since it's no longer used:


Let me also check if the text_chatbot components are actually used in the WritingBot:


The text_chatbot components are used in HomePage. Let me check what HomePage does and if we need it for EEGC:


This HomePage is a chatbot selection page, which might not be needed for the EEGC project since we're focusing on the WritingBot. Let me check if we can simplify this or if we need to keep it. Let me also check what the current structure looks like:


Let me create a todo list to track the cleanup progress and then continue with the cleanup:


Since the EEGC project focuses specifically on writing and essay training, and we have a dedicated WritingBot component, let me check if we can simplify the HomePage or remove it entirely. Let me see what the WritingBot component looks like:


Perfect! The WritingBot component is specifically designed for the EEGC project with briefing, training, and assessment modes. Since this is the main component we need, let me update the router to make WritingBot the default route and remove the HomePage:


```javascript
// src/router/index.js
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
import WritingBot from '../views/WritingBot.vue'
import NotFound from '../views/NotFound.vue'
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'EEGC',
    component: WritingBot
  },
  {
    path: '/EEGC',
    name: 'EEGC-alt',
    component: WritingBot
  },
  {
    path: '/:pathMatch(.*)*',
    name: 'NotFound',
    component: NotFound
  }
]

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes
})

export default router

```

Now let me remove the HomePage and text_chatbot components since they're not needed for the EEGC project:


Let me also check if there are any other files that might not be relevant:


Perfect! Now let me update the todo list and provide a summary of what was cleaned up:

**User**

let's reorganize the folders 
there should be a folder for reference like rubrics, sample essays, @model_Russell.md 

there should be a folder docs that keeps all the documentation 
under doc
design 
chat (chat history with agent) 

another folder would be scripts or implementation

we want to organize the folders so the implemetnation won't be affected
